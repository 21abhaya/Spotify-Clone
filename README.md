# Spotify-Clone
This is a project I am building currently using HTML, CSS & vanilla JS.

I am currently building this simple clone website of the famous music application ‘Spotify’, using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript from Youtube. 
My objective is to revise and improve upon all of what I’ve learnt in the first half of my Web Development course before beginning the second half of the course that covers Node and React.
